              In a far away spot in the cosmos lived two civilizations in a
              solar system orbiting around two Suns.
            </p>
            <p>
              One was the nation of humans. A nation of war, fighting for their
              right to exist for thousands of years. Over the past millennia the
              kingdom was ruled by Princess Gravitas Nexis overseeing the
              progress of the people, leading them on their ways. During her
              reign the nation became stronger and more technologically advanced
              than ever before.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other civilizations was the nation of aliens. The enemy of
              local humans', obsessed with them in the worst way, from the
              moment they first met. The evil organisms' aim was to enslave
              people, and use them for anything they wished, accompanied by
              cruel experiments and torture, what they called "befriending".
              This twisted goal became the entire point of the aliens'
              existence. Out of lots of items repeated in human cultures flower
              motifs were the aliens' favorite, that they incorporated in all of
              theirs destructive inventions.
            </p>
            <p>Wars between the two lasted for thousands of years.</p>

              />
            </div>
            <p>
              During an expedition, one of alien special forces managed to
              obtain a peculiar creature, the body of which was composed of a
              special material that could change its shape after strong energy
              impacts. The aliens tried countless methods to shape the creature
              in the exact way they wanted, some of which succeeded, some of
              which did not. Being conscious, it went thought a lot of
              additional training, main focus of what was to teach the goal of
              the war with humans and for what to fight. But the creature didn't
              share their views, but on the contrary - it sided with the humans,
              which dissatisfied aliens to no end. The leader of the research
              conducted a lot of cruel experiments on the creature, causing it
              great pain. After a while, the "mad scientist" discarded the test
              subject into the open space.
            </p>
            <p>
              The creature remained alive, alone, with nothing left to do and no
              fear of death. With a lot of effort it has managed to get to the
              bay of the humans' space station. The creature passed a single
              gate while a small space ship was unloaded and fueled. The gate
              closed immediately as the base's security system reacted to the
              intrusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess, having the highest authority, learned about it as
              well, and set out to personally meet the intruder lifeform. The
              cat-like creature was left in awe, having only seen Gravitas Nexis
              in its textbooks before. The princess looked cold and serious
              befitting her status.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <div class="item-img float-left">
              <img
                src="img/gravitas-nexis-collapse.png"
                alt="A white haired girl falling to the left in profile and a purple flower blooming from her heart at the back"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Suddenly, the air froze, and shiver went down both of their the
              spines. The creature impaled the princess through her heart with a
              large spear. Apparently, the little alien was embedded with a
              sophisticated attacking system, launching automatically at the
              presence of any human organism. The princess attempted to defend
              herself with a large sword she quickly forged out of thin air, but
              the spear shattered it to pieces, piercing the princess in the
              process. A large flower bloomed from the victim, marking her
              defeat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of the powerful energy impact launching from the creature
              - it took the shape of the princess herself, becoming her perfect
              copy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The door behind the creature opened. Two soldiers charged in to
              catch the intruder, but the alien blew past them without thinking.
              One of them got to helping the wounded princess, while his partner
              ran to catch the impostor. The "new" Princess Gravitas Nexis found
              the same ship from before, quickly jumped in, and flew away.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shapeshifter found human equipment, weapons and a data bank,
              with the ship's cruising path as well as information and images
              featuring itself in its original form, living among humans. After
              reading more into the data, it found out that it was a result of
              the princess' research and development activities all along. The
              memories of which were gone, just as the opportunity to mend what
              has been done. The new pilot's navigation skills were subpar, to
              say the least, so it couldn't make its way back to the base to
              save the face. So it continued its aimless voyage having little
              hope, contemplating, and thinking of what could fill the void
              caused by the recent tragedy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has dressed up in the armor it found to remind itself of what
              it did less, and chose to call itself simply Nexis, to honor the
              legacy of its creator. After a lot of time of travel the
              shapeshifter accidentally encountered the Earth by picking up
              signals from it. It surveyed where it would be safest to land and,
              enabling masking, landed in a forest in Ukraine. Nexis left the
              ship, and went to explore where the journey took her, marking the
              beginning of her life on Earth.
